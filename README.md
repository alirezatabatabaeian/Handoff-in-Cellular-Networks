# ***Handoff in Cellular Networks***

## ***(Alireza Tabatabaeian)***

### ***Introduction:***

***The handoff process involves several steps, including measuring the signal strength of neighboring cells, deciding when to initiate the handoff, selecting the best target cell, and transferring the ongoing session to the new base station. Handoff is critical for providing seamless communication and uninterrupted data services to users, especially when they are on the move. Failure to perform a timely and accurate handoff can result in dropped calls, poor call quality, and disrupted data sessions, which can lead to a negative user experience and loss of revenue for service providers.***

### ***Implementation:***

***In this project, weâ€™ve implemented 4 algorithms to compare the effect of different algorithms in order to choose the least number of handoff happened in a cell :***
